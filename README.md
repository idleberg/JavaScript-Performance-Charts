# JavaScript Performance Charts

Back in late 2012, I benchmarked all versions of Firefox, Chrome and Opera for their JavaScript performance. These tests were performed on Mozilla's [Kraken JavaScript Benchmark 1.1](http://krakenbenchmark.mozilla.org/) and several versions of Google's [V8 Benchmark Suite](http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/data/benchmarks/v7/revisions.html) (and later [Octane](http://octane-benchmark.googlecode.com/svn/latest/index.html).)

Since my old blog has since been taken down and some of the results were recently quoted in resin.io's article [Happy 18th Birthday JavaScript](http://resin.io/happy-18th-birthday-javascript/), I thought it might be a good idea to make the results available.

For details on the testing conditions, please refer to this [archived page](https://web.archive.org/web/20130625190027/http://whyeye.org/blog/browsers/history-of-javascript-performance-chrome/) of the original article.
